# Last Breath 

2D Top-Down RGP where the player acts as a special undead whose main goal is to survive and seek out information about what happened.

## Fractions
The game features four unique factions: Undead, Elves, Dwarves, and Humans, each with their own characteristics and privileges that open up as relationships improve. However, by deepening ties with one faction, you risk antagonising the others, creating a delicate balance between alliances and rivalries.

 ## World Simulation.
The heart and soul of the game lie in its living, breathing world—a dynamic ecosystem where every NPC and monster is more than just a static entity. They are driven by purpose, ambition, and survival instincts. Each character, whether friend or foe, has their own goals—sometimes singular, sometimes multifaceted—that they tirelessly pursue. These goals shape their actions, creating a world that feels alive and unpredictable.

But the world doesn’t stop there. NPCs and monsters don’t exist in isolation; they interact, clash, and evolve. They engage in battles with one another, not just for dominance but for growth. Through these conflicts, they grow stronger, adapt, and even unlock new abilities, becoming more formidable over time. This constant evolution ensures that the world is never stagnant—it’s a place where every encounter feels unique, and every decision you make ripples through the fabric of this ever-changing reality.

In this world, you’re not just a player; you’re a part of an intricate, living tapestry where every thread has its own story, and every story intertwines with yours.

## Combat System
Turn-based combat system with three types of stance. Each stance offers different gameplay from the others. 

**Agility Stance:**
In the agility stance, your character becomes the epitome of grace and speed: his agility attribute increases, making him as elusive as a shadow. The chance to dodge enemy attacks increases, and each strike carries the potential for a critical hit that can turn the tide of battle. This is a style for those who prefer to win not by brute force, but by grace and cunning.

**Strength Stance:**
In the power stance, your character becomes an unshakable fortress: his power attribute increases, and with it the damage dealt, turning each blow into a crushing blow of fate. 
This is the choice for those who believe that the best defence is attack, and victory is achieved through absolute superiority.

**Intelligence Stance:**
In the Intelligence stance, your character becomes a master of the magical arts: his intelligence attribute increases, and with it the magic damage, capable of scorching enemies with a single spell. But intelligence isn't just about attacking, it's also about defence: the energy barrier surrounding your character becomes stronger, deflecting blows and keeping him safe. This is the path for those who prefer to win with their mind rather than their sword, and who believe that knowledge is power.
